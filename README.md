# Waypoint Digital Library

Waypoint Digital Library is a static-first reference implementation of a university-caliber digital library that can run entirely on GitHub Pages. The project pairs Astro, Tailwind CSS, and lightweight Alpine.js islands with a GitHub Actions publishing pipeline that converts Markdown source files into web, EPUB, and PDF deliverables.

## Features

- **Astro + Tailwind UI:** Component-driven site shell with dark mode, responsive layouts, and reusable design primitives.
- **Record-driven architecture:** Catalog metadata is stored in `_records/` Markdown files with YAML front matter, while long-form works live in `books/<slug>/` folders.
- **Client-side discovery:** A prebuilt `/search/index.json` is queried with Fuse.js for search and filtering experiences.
- **Readers:** Inline PDF previews, EPUB reader shell, and placeholders for IIIF Mirador integration.
- **Automation:** GitHub Actions workflows stubbed for building the search index, validating metadata, and deploying the Astro site.
